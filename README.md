Here's an Xorg configuration file (`/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-gpu.conf`) tailored for an HP ZBook Studio G3 that utilizes the Intel HD Graphics 530 for display and the NVIDIA Quadro M2000M for compute on Rocky Linux 8:

Yes, the Flame Family products do require the DKU (Driver Kernel Update) for proper operation, especially on Linux systems. Here's a more detailed guide on how to set up your system correctly:

1. **Install Necessary Drivers:**
   - Ensure that you have the appropriate drivers for both GPUs installed on your system.

   For Intel HD Graphics:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install xorg-x11-drv-intel
   ```

   For NVIDIA Quadro M2000M:
   - Add the EPEL repository and install the NVIDIA driver:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install epel-release
   sudo dnf install dkms
   sudo dnf install https://download1.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/el/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-8.noarch.rpm
   sudo dnf install akmod-nvidia
   sudo dnf install xorg-x11-drv-nvidia-cuda
   ```

2. **Install the DKU:**
   - Download the appropriate DKU version from the Autodesk website.
   - Follow the instructions provided by Autodesk to install the DKU. This typically involves running an installation script that will configure your system to work with Flame Family products.

3. **Configure Xorg for Dual GPU:**
   - Edit the Xorg configuration file to use Intel for display and NVIDIA for computing.

   Create or edit the Xorg configuration file `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-gpu.conf`:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-gpu.conf
   ```

   Add the following configuration:
   ```bash
   Section "ServerLayout"
       Identifier "layout"
       Screen 0 "intel"
       Inactive "nvidia"
   EndSection

   Section "Device"
       Identifier "intel"
       Driver "intel"
       BusID "PCI:0:2:0"
   EndSection

   Section "Screen"
       Identifier "intel"
       Device "intel"
   EndSection

   Section "Device"
       Identifier "nvidia"
       Driver "nvidia"
       BusID "PCI:1:0:0"
       Option "AllowEmptyInitialConfiguration"
   EndSection

   Section "Screen"
       Identifier "nvidia"
       Device "nvidia"
   EndSection
   ```

4. **Set NVIDIA as the Primary GPU for Computing:**
   - For applications like Autodesk Flame, DaVinci Resolve, and Autodesk Maya, you need to specify that they use the NVIDIA GPU for computation. This is often done by setting environment variables or within the application settings.

   For example, you can set the environment variable `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` to specify which GPU to use:
   ```bash
   export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0  # Assuming NVIDIA GPU is device 0
   ```

5. **Configure Each Application:**
   - **Autodesk Flame:** Refer to Autodesk's documentation to ensure Flame uses the NVIDIA GPU for processing. Installation of the DKU typically includes steps for configuring Flame to use the correct GPU.
   - **DaVinci Resolve:** In Resolve, go to `Preferences` > `System` > `Memory and GPU` and set the GPU configuration to use the NVIDIA GPU.
   - **Autodesk Maya:** Maya typically uses the primary GPU by default, but you can verify this in Maya's settings or through environment variables.

6. **Reboot and Verify:**
   - Reboot your system to apply the changes:
   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

   - Verify that the Intel GPU is used for display and the NVIDIA GPU is available for computation. You can use commands like `nvidia-smi` to check the status of the NVIDIA GPU.

By following these steps and ensuring you have the DKU installed, you should be able to effectively utilize both GPUs on your HP ZBook for your specified applications on Rocky Linux 8.


Intel General Purpose Graphics on Linux (also known as Intel GPU Compute) provides an open-source platform for general-purpose GPU computing on Intel graphics processors. For your HP ZBook with an Intel HD Graphics 530, you can use this platform to offload some compute tasks to the Intel GPU. This can be useful if you want to balance the load between the Intel and NVIDIA GPUs.

Here's how you can set up and utilize Intel General Purpose Graphics on Rocky Linux 8:

1. **Install the Intel OpenCL Runtime:**
   - You need to install the Intel OpenCL runtime to enable OpenCL support on the Intel GPU.

   ```bash
   sudo dnf install ocl-icd
   sudo dnf install intel-opencl
   ```

2. **Verify OpenCL Installation:**
   - After installation, you can verify that the OpenCL runtime is correctly installed and the Intel GPU is recognized.

   ```bash
   clinfo | grep "Platform Name\|Device Name"
   ```

   You should see output indicating the Intel platform and device.

3. **Install the Intel Compute Runtime:**
   - The Intel Compute Runtime is an open-source implementation of the OpenCL and Level Zero standards for Intel GPUs. 

   Add the repository and install the runtime:
   ```bash
   sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/intel-opencl.repo <<EOF
   [intel-opencl]
   name=Intel(R) Graphics Compute Runtime for OpenCL(TM)
   baseurl=https://repositories.intel.com/graphics/rpm/rhel8
   enabled=1
   gpgcheck=1
   gpgkey=https://repositories.intel.com/graphics/intel-graphics.key
   EOF

   sudo dnf install intel-opencl-clang intel-ocloc intel-opencl
   ```

4. **Configure Applications to Use Intel GPU:**
   - For applications like DaVinci Resolve and Autodesk Maya, you may need to configure them to recognize and use the Intel GPU for specific tasks.

   **DaVinci Resolve:**
   - Open DaVinci Resolve and go to `Preferences` > `System` > `Memory and GPU`.
   - In the GPU configuration, you should see both the Intel and NVIDIA GPUs. Select the Intel GPU for tasks where you want to offload computation.

   **Autodesk Flame:**
   - Ensure that Flame is configured to use the Intel GPU for specific tasks. This may involve modifying configuration files or setting environment variables as specified in the Flame documentation.

   **Autodesk Maya:**
   - Maya can use multiple GPUs for different tasks. Ensure that the Intel GPU is available and recognized by Maya.

5. **Balancing Load Between GPUs:**
   - You can use the Intel GPU for less intensive tasks or as a secondary compute device. For example, you might configure rendering tasks to use the NVIDIA GPU while using the Intel GPU for other computations.

   **Environment Variable:**
   ```bash
   export GPU_DEVICE=Intel # This is just an example; actual configuration may vary
   ```

6. **Reboot and Verify:**
   - Reboot your system to ensure that all changes take effect.

   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

   - Use `clinfo` again to verify that both GPUs are available and correctly configured.

By following these steps, you should be able to set up and utilize the Intel General Purpose Graphics on Rocky Linux 8, allowing you to balance the compute load between your Intel HD Graphics 530 and NVIDIA Quadro M2000M.

2. **Intel Device Section:**
   - Configures the Intel GPU with the `intel` driver.
   - The `BusID` is set to `PCI:0:2:0` which is typical for the Intel HD Graphics.
   - Options like `AccelMethod`, `TearFree`, and `DRI` are set for better performance and screen tearing prevention.

3. **Intel Screen Section:**
   - Associates the Intel GPU with a screen and a monitor, setting the default depth to 24 bits and the resolution to 1920x1080.

4. **Monitor Section:**
   - Defines the monitor settings, including DPMS (Display Power Management Signaling).

5. **NVIDIA Device Section:**
   - Configures the NVIDIA GPU with the `nvidia` driver.
   - The `BusID` is set to `PCI:1:0:0` which corresponds to the NVIDIA Quadro M2000M.
   - `AllowEmptyInitialConfiguration` allows the NVIDIA GPU to be used without configuring a display.
   - `Coolbits` is set to `28` to enable overclocking options if needed.

6. **NVIDIA Screen Section:**
   - Defines a screen for the NVIDIA GPU, though it will not be active for display.

7. **Module Section:**
   - Ensures the `glx` module is loaded, which is necessary for 3D rendering.

8. **Files Section:**
   - Sets the module paths to ensure the correct NVIDIA modules are used.

### Apply and Reboot:

1. **Save and Close the File:**
   - Save the configuration file and close the editor.

2. **Reboot the System:**
