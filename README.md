Here's a tailored for my HP ZBook Studio G3 that utilizes the Intel HD Graphics 530 for display and the NVIDIA Quadro M2000M for compute on Rocky Linux 8:


 **Install Necessary Drivers:**
   - Ensure that you have the appropriate drivers for both GPUs installed on your system.

1. **Install the Intel OpenCL Runtime:**
   - You need to install the Intel OpenCL runtime to enable OpenCL support on the Intel GPU.

   Add the repository and install the runtime:
   ```bash
   sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/intel-opencl.repo <<EOF
   [intel-opencl]
   name=Intel(R) Graphics Compute Runtime for OpenCL(TM)
   baseurl=https://repositories.intel.com/graphics/rpm/rhel8
   enabled=1
   gpgcheck=1
   gpgkey=https://repositories.intel.com/graphics/intel-graphics.key
   EOF

   sudo dnf install intel-opencl-clang intel-ocloc intel-opencl
   ```



2. **Install the DKU:**
   - Download the appropriate DKU version from the Autodesk website.
     https://www.autodesk.com/support/technical/article/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/CentOS-ISO-installer-and-Linux-Driver-Kernel-Utilities-for-Flame-Family.html

Download the correct DKU from the system requirements web page, for example: Flame System Requirements and extract the contents of the file, for example: tar -xvf <DKU_file_name>.tar.
In the directory where the DKU was extracted, run the following to install the DKU: ./INSTALL_DKU. For usage, type INSTALL_DKU --help.
If a Wacom tablet or storage devices were disconnected or turned off as part of the OS installation, reconnect and power them up.
Restart the workstation with reboot.






Sure, here are the files you need to create and configure:

### 1. `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-intel.conf`

```bash
sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-intel.conf
```

Add the following content:

```plaintext
Section "Device"
    Identifier "IntelGPU"
    Driver "intel"
    BusID "PCI:0:2:0"
    Option "AccelMethod" "sna"
    Option "TearFree" "true"
    Option "DRI" "3"
EndSection

Section "Screen"
    Identifier "ScreenIntel"
    Device "IntelGPU"
    Monitor "Monitor0"
    DefaultDepth 24
    SubSection "Display"
        Depth 24
        Modes "1920x1080"
    EndSubSection
EndSection

Section "Monitor"
    Identifier "Monitor0"
    Option "DPMS"
EndSection
```

### 2. `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-nvidia.conf`

```bash
sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-nvidia.conf
```

Add the following content:

```plaintext
Section "Device"
    Identifier "NvidiaGPU"
    Driver "nvidia"
    BusID "PCI:1:0:0"
    Option "AllowEmptyInitialConfiguration"
    Option "Coolbits" "28"
EndSection

Section "Screen"
    Identifier "ScreenNvidia"
    Device "NvidiaGPU"
EndSection

Section "Module"
    Load "glx"
EndSection

Section "Files"
    ModulePath "/usr/lib64/nvidia/xorg"
    ModulePath "/usr/lib64/xorg/modules"
EndSection
```

### 3. `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/30-layout.conf`

```bash
sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/30-layout.conf
```

Add the following content:

```plaintext
Section "ServerLayout"
    Identifier "layout"
    Screen 0 "ScreenIntel"
    Inactive "ScreenNvidia"
EndSection
```

### Applying and Verifying Configuration

1. **Save and Close the Files:**
   - Save each file after editing by pressing `Ctrl+X`, then `Y`, and `Enter`.

2. **Reboot the System:**
   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

3. **Verify Configuration:**
   - After rebooting, verify that the Intel GPU is being used for display and the NVIDIA GPU is available for compute tasks.

   To check the NVIDIA GPU status:
   ```bash
   nvidia-smi
   ```

   To verify the Intel GPU, you can use `xrandr` or `glxinfo` commands.

This setup should ensure that Autodesk Flame and other applications can utilize the Intel HD Graphics 530 for display and the NVIDIA Quadro M2000M for compute tasks on Rocky Linux 8.




   **Autodesk Flame:**
   - Ensure that Flame is configured to use the Intel GPU for specific tasks. This may involve modifying configuration files or setting environment variables as specified in the Flame documentation.

   **Autodesk Maya:**
   - Maya can use multiple GPUs for different tasks. Ensure that the Intel GPU is available and recognized by Maya.

5. **Balancing Load Between GPUs:**
   - You can use the Intel GPU for less intensive tasks or as a secondary compute device. For example, you might configure rendering tasks to use the NVIDIA GPU while using the Intel GPU for other computations.

   **Environment Variable:**
   ```bash
   export GPU_DEVICE=Intel # This is just an example; actual configuration may vary
   ```

6. **Reboot and Verify:**
   - Reboot your system to ensure that all changes take effect.

   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

   - Use `clinfo` again to verify that both GPUs are available and correctly configured.

By following these steps, you should be able to set up and utilize the Intel General Purpose Graphics on Rocky Linux 8, allowing you to balance the compute load between your Intel HD Graphics 530 and NVIDIA Quadro M2000M.

### Explanation:

1. **ServerLayout Section:**
   - Defines the layout of the screens, specifying that the Intel GPU (`Screen 0 "intel"`) is active and the NVIDIA GPU (`Inactive "nvidia"`) is inactive.

2. **Intel Device Section:**
   - Configures the Intel GPU with the `intel` driver.
   - The `BusID` is set to `PCI:0:2:0` which is typical for the Intel HD Graphics.
   - Options like `AccelMethod`, `TearFree`, and `DRI` are set for better performance and screen tearing prevention.

3. **Intel Screen Section:**
   - Associates the Intel GPU with a screen and a monitor, setting the default depth to 24 bits and the resolution to 1920x1080.

4. **Monitor Section:**
   - Defines the monitor settings, including DPMS (Display Power Management Signaling).

5. **NVIDIA Device Section:**
   - Configures the NVIDIA GPU with the `nvidia` driver.
   - The `BusID` is set to `PCI:1:0:0` which corresponds to the NVIDIA Quadro M2000M.
   - `AllowEmptyInitialConfiguration` allows the NVIDIA GPU to be used without configuring a display.
   - `Coolbits` is set to `28` to enable overclocking options if needed.

6. **NVIDIA Screen Section:**
   - Defines a screen for the NVIDIA GPU, though it will not be active for display.

7. **Module Section:**
   - Ensures the `glx` module is loaded, which is necessary for 3D rendering.

8. **Files Section:**
   - Sets the module paths to ensure the correct NVIDIA modules are used.

### Apply and Reboot:

1. **Save and Close the File:**
   - Save the configuration file and close the editor.

2. **Reboot the System:**
   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

3. **Verify the Configuration:**
   - After rebooting, verify that the Intel GPU is being used for display and the NVIDIA GPU is available for compute tasks.

   ```bash
   nvidia-smi
   ```

   - To verify the Intel GPU, you can use `xrandr` or `glxinfo` commands.

This configuration should allow Autodesk Flame and other applications to utilize both the Intel HD Graphics 530 for display purposes and the NVIDIA Quadro M2000M for compute tasks effectively on Rocky Linux 8.
